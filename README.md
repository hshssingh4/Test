# Tips-iOS-Project
# Pre-work - *Tips*

**Tips** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Harpreet Singh**

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total. Although I spent 13 hours in total making the original app,
I spent 4 extra hours in making it again since I lost the code while pushing to GitHub.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* UI animations, plus other color, layout, as well as font changes.
- Animations include a top down animation of the text field when the field is empty and and a bottom up
animation as soon as the user starts typing.
* Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. 
This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
* User can choose between a light and a dark theme. 

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- App icon has been added for all cases (settings, spotlight, and home screen).
- Launch screen has been added that displays app's name, its icon, as well as the builder's name (i.e. mine).
- A slider has been added that allow user to choose a custom tip percentage.
- Switches have been added to let the user decide whether he/she needs default amounts or custom ones.

## Notes

I faced quite a lot of challenges while posting the app on github, maybe not so much while building it. As already
mentioned, I lost the app while uploading it to Git Hub using its desktop version. Then, I spent about 4-5 hours again
in making this app despite knowing that the finals are on head because I couldn't imagine loosing this invaluable 
opportunity for which I had been longing so much. Apart from that, the only major challenge I faced while building the app
was adding the app icon despite knowing it was very easy. The reason why that happened was because I had never used
any image editors before and I had no idea as to what will help in this case. Then I downloaded "Pixlr" as suggested
by my brother and was able to finish that task finally.
